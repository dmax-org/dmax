# 🌌 D-MAX — Your Open-Source Digital Twin & AI Assistant

D-MAX is an open-source initiative to build a **digital twin** that learns how you think, how you talk, and how you act — then works as your **personal AI assistant**.  
Think of it as your second self: always available, always learning, always improving.

🚀 *This is not science fiction. This is your future.*

## ✨ Vision

We believe everyone should have access to a **trusted, transparent AI twin** — not locked behind a company’s servers.  
D-MAX will be:

- 🧠 **Personal** — learns your style, memory, and preferences  
- 🔐 **Private** — your data stays yours  
- 🤝 **Collaborative** — built by the community, for the community
